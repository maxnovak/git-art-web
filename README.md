## Description
Front facing webapp that utilizes a golang api to create some pretty github art :)
This [React](https://reactjs.org/) app utilizes [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for compilation and is based on [nano-react-app](https://github.com/adrianmcli/nano-react-app) template.

## Getting Started

- `yarn start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `1234`.
- `yarn build` — This will output a production build in the `dist` directory.
- `yarn typecheck` — This will run `tsc --noEmit` which basically just typechecks your project.
- `yarn typewatch` — This will run `tsc --noEmit --watch` which will typecheck your project as you make changes.
